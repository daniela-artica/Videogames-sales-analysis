# Videogames sales analysis
## Project background

The main goal of the project is to provide a historical videogames sales analysis in order to uncover critical insights that will allow a worldwide videogame store identify promising projects and improve advertising campaign planning.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
- Videogames sales trends analysis: evaluation of historical sales patterns, both globally and by platforms
- Analysis of the most profitable platforms and genres, both globally and by region
- Analysis of factors influencing total sales: an asessment of how user and critics ratings affect total sales
- User profile by region: analysis of the most profitable platforms and genres in 3 key regions

## Executive summary
**Overview of findings**
- Sales peaked in specific years due to major platform releases and hit games. The analysis showed that the introduction of new technologies in consoles significantly impacts their profitability. As newer consoles are launched, older ones experience a decline in revenue while the profitability of the newer generation rises.
- The five most profitable platforms- PS2, Xbox 360, PS3, Wii, and DSâ€”each generated over $800 million in sales.
- Sony platforms like PS2 and PS3 perform well across all regions.
- Certain genres like action, sports and shooter games consistently dominated sales across all regions.

## Key insights
**Most profitable platforms per region:**
- Japanese players prefer platforms like Nintendo DS with 175 millions of dollars in sales.
- North american players prefer Xbox 360 generating nearly 600 millions of dollars in sales, followed by PS2 with 580 millions.
- European players prefer platforms like PS2 and PS3 with 337 and 327 millions of dollares in sales, respectively.

**Most profitable genres per region:**
- Japanese players seem to buy more role-playing games above other kinds of genres.
- European and north american players seem to have similar preferences, since action, sports and shooter games generated most sales on those two regions.

**Factors influencing games sales:**
- The Xbox 360 case reveals that user ratings don't seem to have a strong impact on console sales. However, there is a slight correlation between critic scores and sales: higher sales are often associated with better reviews, and vice versa.
- Game ratings play a role in sales, with titles rated "E" (Everyone), "T" (Teen), and "M" (Mature +17) generally seeing the highest sales.

## Recommendations
1. **Focus on Next-Generation Consoles:** The data shows that newer consoles, especially those incorporating advanced technologies, tend to perform better in terms of profitability. While older consoles like the PS2, Xbox 360, and PS3 have historically been profitable, new consoles should be prioritized in development and marketing to capture rising demand and boost long-term sales.

2. **Target Popular Game Genres:** Action, sports, and shooter games are the most profitable genres. Focusing on developing games within these genres could help ensure higher sales.
   
3. **Consider Regional Preferences in Game and Console Releases:** Regional preferences play a significant role in determining sales success. Tailoring game releases to these regional preferences will help maximize sales potential.
  
4. **Capitalize on Sony Platforms' Strong Regional Performance:** Sony platforms like PS2 and PS3 perform well across all regions. For developers, this suggests that targeting the PlayStation family of consoles with region-specific content could be a smart strategy to optimize sales in North America, Europe, and Japan.
